<B>EFFECTS</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

All the effects in Broadcast 2000 are provided by plugins.  While many
effects can run in realtime, on the console, effects that change the
duration of a selection or require some random access must be done from
the effect menus.  Audio and video effects are organized seperately.<P>

<B>NON-REALTIME EFFECTS</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Effects which can't run in realtime are organized seperately into the
<B>Audio</B> and <B>Video</B> menus.  When selecting the
<B>Effects...</B> menu option, you get a list of effects to process on
the selected region and <A HREF="formatwindow.html">information for a
file</A> to write the processed data to.  Notice the effects include
realtime plugins, transitions and non realtime effects.<P>

The data to be processed is selected first by which tracks are
<B>playable</B> and next by which <B>region</B> is selected.<P>

If <B>Overwrite project with output</B> is selected, the output is
written to only the <B>recordable</B> tracks.  Thus footage on playable
tracks need not be overwritten by an effect but the effect output can
be written to other tracks.  Suppose you want to normalize tracks on a
CD you just ripped.  You would create two new tracks, unrecord the two
existing tracks and unplay the two new tracks.  Then perform normalize
so the normalized output is pasted on the new tracks for comparison
with the old tracks.

<B>REALTIME EFFECTS</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

These can be run on the console.  The normal way to run an effect is to
click a <B>Plugin</B> button on the console and select <B>Attach</B>. 
More information on this kind of processing is in <A
HREF="console.html">the console</A><P>

<B>TRANSITIONS</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Transitions in Broadcast 2000 are implemented by creating an extra
video or audio track to paste transitions on.  You can optionally paste
footage on the same track as your transitions or use the track
specifically for transitions.  Next you route footage from other tracks
through the transition track, forcing it to be processed by the
transition.<P>

There are many ways of routing footage through the transition track. 
The method I use is creating 3 video tracks such that two contain
footage and the third track contains only transitions.  Attach the
transition module to both footage tracks with <B>in</B> and <B>out</B>
selected.  Mute the footage tracks but not the transition track.  Set
the footage tracks as <B>playable</B> but set the transition track as
<B>not playable</B>.<P>

<A HREF="transitionconsole.png">Here</A> is what the console looks
like.<P>

Now footage from both footage tracks passes through the transition
module and any transitions that you paste on the transition track.<P>

The next step is <B>pasting transitions</B>.  Select a region on the
timeline.  Make sure only the <B>transition track</B> is recordable. 
Select <B>Paste transition</B> from the video menu.  The same plugins
that are available on the console can be pasted as transitions.<P>

<A HREF="transitiontimeline.jpg">Here</A> is what the timeline looks
like with a transition.<P>

Once you paste a transition, <B>right click</B> on it to get a list of
options for the transition.  The behavior is the same as console
plugins.  The transition is rendered first in the module except the
transition is only processed where it is pasted.<P>

Audio plugins can also be pasted as transitions for audio.<P>
