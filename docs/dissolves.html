Broadcast 2000 contains features to very quickly insert dissolves
between two scenes.  In Broadcast 2000 you paste the two scenes next to
each other so you have a timeline like this:<P>

<IMG SRC="dissolve1.png"><P>


Then you select the region between the two edits<P>

Select <B>Video->feather edits</B> to commence the dissolve operation. 
This asks you for a number of frames to extend the dissolve.  With the
number of frames entered, you now get a dissolve when you play the
selection.  To remove the dissolve go back to <B>Video->feather
edits</B> and enter 0 for the frame duration.<P>

The <B>Feather edits</B> operation is identical to if you created the
following timeline.  Here the bottom scene faded out after the top
scene began.<P>
