<IMG SRC="transport.png" ALIGN=RIGHT>
Playback functions are all controlled from the transport.<P>

Hit the <IMG SRC="fastforward.png"> fast forward, <IMG
SRC="fastreverse.png"> fast reverse, <IMG SRC="reverseplay.png">
reverse play, and <IMG SRC="play.png"> forward play to hear what
shuttling is like.  The frame advance buttons <IMG SRC="framereverse.png"><IMG SRC="frameforward.png">are only useful
for video.  The audio is rendered in realtime at normal speed before
it is stretched or condensed, so slow systems may drop samples.  <P>

Once you've mastered the transport, you can try out the keyboard equivalents:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>spacebar</B> -> start/pause forward playback<BR>
<B>k</B> -> stop playback<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The number pad with numlock off is much more powerful than the
mouse:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>4</B> -> single frame reverse<BR>
<B>5</B> -> 1/2 speed reverse playback<BR>
<B>6</B> -> normal speed reverse playback<BR>
<B>+</B> -> fast reverse playback<BR>
<B>1</B> -> single frame forward<BR>
<B>2</B> -> 1/2 speed forward playback<BR>
<B>3</B> -> normal speed forward playback<BR>
<B>Enter</B> -> fast forward playback<BR>
<B>0</B> -> Stop<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Pressing any button or key twice pauses it.  Likewise, pressing
<B>space</B> pauses and resumes the currently active direction.<P>

For point and click operations, the speed of the fast forward and fast
reverse buttons can be toggled by going to <B>Settings->Slow
Shuttle.</B>  On a
fast system with Broadcast 2000's transport, you'll be very good at
scanning CD rips for jitter and scratches.<P>
