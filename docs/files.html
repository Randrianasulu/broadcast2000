All data that you work with in Broadcast 2000 is loaded using
<B>load</B> and <B>append</B>.<P>

The loading and playing of files is just as you would expect.  Just go
to <B>File->Load</B> and select a file for loading.  Hit the forward
play button <IMG SRC="play.png"> and it should start playing,
regardless of whether a progress bar has popped up.  If it pops up a
progress bar, it's because Broadcast 2000 decided an index file would
be faster to draw than reading every audio sample directly.<P>

Loading usually changes the current project's attributes to match the
loaded file.  Loading still images creates a new project with default
values.<P>

The <B>Append</B> command adds tracks containing a new file without
deleting the current project.  Appending doesn't change the current
project's attributes.<P>

Eventually you'll want to save your work.  Saving files in the
post-production world doesn't work like it does in the computer science
textbook.  When you select <B>File->save as</B> you don't save data. 
You save pointers to areas on disk where your assets are located.  When
you load these pointers, your project reappears just like you saved the
data itself.<P>

If you want to save audio and video data you need to do a
<B>render</B>.

Selecting <B>File->Render...</B> causes Broadcast 2000 to create an
audio or video file that you can play on a movie player and all your
roommates can use but <B>doesn't</B> save any console or edit
information.  The region of the timeline you highlight is important.<P>

If a region is selected <B>Rendering</B> saves the selected part of the
timeline.  If nothing is selected rendering saves the entire region
after the cursor.<P>

Rendering presents you with a <A HREF="formatwindow.html">File format
dialog</A>.  If <B>Overwrite project with output</B> is selected the
rendered output is pasted onto the recordable tracks.<P>

Broadcast 2000 tries really hard to copy video directly from the source
assets to the output file without recompressing it but this is only
possible when the asset and output file use the same compression among
other things.<P>
