<B>AUTOMATION</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The automation is displayed using the <B>View</B> menu settings.<P>

From here, <B>fade, pan, play, mute, various plugin parameters, camera,
and projector</B> settings can be changed for any moment in the
timeline.  In fact the only way to control camera and projector
settings for video is automation.  For audio, the <B>Fade and Pan</B>
settings are offsetted with automation.  The automation specifies an
offset to be added to the console's setting.  <B>Play and Mute</B>
settings override the console.<P>

Automation is drawn over the track view.  Create and drag automation
points with the pointer.  For audio, the <B>Shift</B> key tries to lock
the automation setting to a desirable point while dragging.<P>

Automation can be edited much like text, by selecting regions and using
the <B>Edit</B> menu's automation functions.  The only automation
affected by automation editing is what is selected as displayable. 
This way you can selectively cut and paste automation while leaving
other automation untouched.<P>

While <B>panning</B> is controlled by a box in the console the pan
automation consists of an offset to add to each channel so it's
possible to have both channels muted.  This is not the recommended
method for muting, mind you.<P>

The effect of <B>plugin automation</B> depends on the plugin.  The
plugin should have a word like <B>(automated)</B> by the function which
is affected by its automation line.  Not all plugins are automated. 
The plugin automation specifies a fraction of the maximum value of the
plugin's parameter to be added to  the parameter's setting.
