<B>SECRETS OF BROADCAST 2000</B><P>

<B>MAKING A CD</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Create a project of 2 audio tracks 44100 kHz sampling and 2 output
channels.  Paste in the complete contents of your CD on the timeline
exactly as it should play back.  Insert silence between tracks. 
Perform normalization on selected areas of the timeline to maximize the
bit depth while not creating uneven volume levels.  Insert labels at
track division points and remove any extranneous labels.<P>

Position the cursor at the beginning of the program and select
<B>File->render list...</B>  Specify a filename containing a two digit
0 padded number like <B>track01.wav</B>.  This is the filename for the
first track written to disk.  Select WAV format, 16 bits, undithered. 
Render it and Broadcast 2000 will automatically create a new file
wherever there is a label.

<B>MAKING VIDEO EASIER TO SEE</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It's easier to see video when the video windows are always on top. 
This can be set by configuring your window manager.  For fvwm2 a line
like this:<P>

<CODE>
Style "Bcast: Video*"   StaysOnTop<P>
</CODE>

in your <B>system.fvwmrc</B> file does it.

<B>BLURRING OUT CERTAIN PARTS OF A FRAME</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Boot up The Gimp.  Create an RGB image with transparent background. 
Draw a white filled circle or box by first selecting a region then
filling it white.  Save as .png.<P>

Boot up Broadcast 2000.  Load up one track with the video.  Append the
.png image you just created into another track.<P>

Adjust <B>camera</B> automation on your .png image so that it blocks
out the section of the video you want to blur.<P>

Attach a <B>Swap channels</B> plugin to the .png track and arrange the
channels thus:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>alpha -> red<BR>
alpha -> green<BR>
alpha -> blue<BR>
100% -> alpha<BR></B>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Change the <B>mode</B> on the .png image track to <B>multiply</B>.

Render the video as a movie with high quality.  Alpha channels don't
have to be enabled for this step.<P>

Import the new movie as a new track below the original movie.  Apply
<B>Chroma key</B> followed by <B>Blur</B> to the new track.  Set the
chroma key to perfect black with a threshold of 1.  Turn off the
<B>.png</B> track and play back.  Alpha channels have to be enabled. 
For lossless alpha channels use floating point.<P>

<B>BEEPING OUT WORDS</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Load up the movie to be censored.  Mute its audio track but keep it
playable.  Create a new audio track and disable its playback. 
<B>Attach</B> the new track to the movie's audio track with <B>send</B>
and <B>recieve</B> selected.<P>

Create a third audio track, disable its playback, mute it and attach a
<B>Synthesizer</B> to it with <B>Send</B> disabled but <B>Recieve</B>
enabled.<P>

Wherever you want to beep out the sound, paste a <B>transition</B> into
the second audio track.  Attach the transition to the third module with
<B>send</B> and <B>recieve</B> enabled.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>LOADING A DIRECTORY FULL OF MP3s</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

cd into the directory and type bcast2000 *.  Wait for all the tracks to
be inserted.<P>

Disable recording on all tracks except the first two by shift clicking
on the first track patch button and dragging over the second track's
patch button.<P>

Select <B>tracks->concatenate tracks</B>.<P>

Make every track recordable by shift clicking the first track's patch
button twice.  Then switch off recording for the first two tracks. 
Select <B>tracks->delete tracks</B>.<P>
