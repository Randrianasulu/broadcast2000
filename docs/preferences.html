<B>VIDEO</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Video operations have a seperate section from audio.  Like audio, video
is recorded in a pipeline but unlike audio, the video device has a
configurable buffer size.  <B>Frames to buffer in device</B> determines
how many frames ahead of the current capture position the device should
buffer but not write to disk.  Setting this to a large number and
capturing below the maximum framerate of the device will cause video to
be delayed.  This is only available when using a Video4Linux 2 driver. 
Unfortunately for most purposes Video4Linux 2 has never achieved usable
functionality.<P>

<B>Frames to record to disk</B> determines the number of frames to read
from the device and compress to disk at a time.  This number doesn't
cause a delay.<P>

The rendering speed can be improved by selecting one of the 4 rendering
modes:  <B>fastest, alpha channels, floating point, and
interpolated</B>  The quality improves and speed decreases as you go
down.  <B>Alpha channels</B> without floats is lossy.  <B>Fastest
rendering</B> is lossless and should always be used when you have no
scaling or alpha channels.<P>

The <B>record driver</B> selects which driver to capture video from. 
When <B>Video4Linux</B> is selected Broadcast 2000 automatically
determines what variant is installed and tries to match it.<P>
