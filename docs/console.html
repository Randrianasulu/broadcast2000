<B>THE CONSOLE</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

When Broadcast 2000 plays back, it reads large chunks of data from
disk, asynchronously sends small fragments through the console, and
overlays the output of each module onto the output channels.  The same
thing happens for video, but video is overlayed on a single output
frame instead of channels.  Make sure <B>Window->show console</B> is
checked, to bring up the console.  As you can see, each track on the
timeline is routed through a module.<P>

It's possible to even synthesize sounds from the console but you must
turn off <B>disable tracks when no edits</B> in
<B>preferences->playback</B>.<P>

Start playing a file and tweek the faders.  The <B>O</B> buttons
reset the meters in case you clip.  The <B>pan box</B> was designed to
support more than 2 channels.  For 2 channel panning, more precision
can be achieved by moving the cross to the bottom of the box and
panning left and right.  Track titles can be entered from the console
as well.<P>

Resize the console window and see what happens.<P>

<B>PLUGINS</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The console is really a very powerful realtime signal processor.  By
attaching plugins to the boxes labeled <B>"plugin"</B> you route
signals through the plugins and back to the module.<P>

The signal from a track first goes through <B>Inv</B> which inverts the
signal.  This is used for phase cancellation.<P>

Then the signal goes through each <B>plugin</B> button.  Press on a
plugin button then <B>Attach...</B>.  You get a <B>Plugins</B> list,
an empty <B>Shared Plugins</B> list, and a <B>Modules</B> list with
some tracks in it.<P>

Selecting an item in any list and hitting <B>Attach</B> causes the
module to route signals through that item, whether it's another module,
a plugin, or a previously attached plugin on another module.<P>

Attaching a plugin is straightforward, but if you want to duplicate the
effect for several tracks, adjusting the settings for every plugin can
suck.  Instead, you can attach one plugin to one module.  For other
modules, the original plugin pops up in the <B>shared</B> list. 
Attaching it as a <B>shared plugin</B> causes the single plugin to
process data for the second module, without a second set of controls. 
Some plugins, like reverb, mix the signals from both modules so be
careful.<P>

The <B>Send</B> and <B>Recv</B> settings determine where the plugin gets
its input and where it puts its output.  Deselecting <B>Send</B> stops
the plugin from getting its input from the module it's attached to. 
This is useful for a tone generator that doesn't take any input at
all.  Deselecting <B>Recv</B> prevents the plugin from sending its
output back to the current module.  This is used for bouncing a signal
to another module, without destroying the original signal.<P>

After passing through all the plugins, a sigal goes through the
<B>Fade</B>.  When you attach a module as a plugin, the output of the
plugin, if <B>Out</B> was activated, is the faded signal from the other
module.<P>

After fading, the final process is either <B>Panning</B> or
<B>Muting</B> depending on the <B>Mute</B> setting.  If mute is
selected, the signal is discarded.  Otherwise it is mixed into the
final output channels according to the pan box setting.  <B>Muting</B>
is useful when one module acts as the fader to another module's
plugin.<P>

Suppose you want a reverb, but you want to fade out the signal without
fading out the reverberation.  By routing the signal through a muted
second module, which fades out, and then through a reverb in the
original module, the reverb continues after the signal is faded out.
