<TITLE>Using the LML33</TITLE>



<B>THE LML33</B><P>

The <A HREF="http://linuxmedialabs.com">LML33</A> can be used for video
I/O between Broadcast 2000 and analog devices.<P>


<B>DRIVER INSTALLATION</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

There are about half a dozen drivers for the LML33 each with different
interfaces.  Broadcast 2000 uses the <A
HREF="http://linuxmedialabs.com/lml33src/"><B>"VideoStreams"</B></A>
driver.  On a multiprocessor machine, compile the driver with <B>make
-j 1</B>.  The driver takes many options at load time for the I/O
ports, bitrate, and standard.  A sample installation using the S-Video
ports, D1 resolution, and high quality JPEG compression is<P>

<B>insmod lml33 bitrate=400000 video_stream=1 video_input=2
video_output=2</B><P>

You also have to create device nodes using <B>mkvidnodes</B><P>

<B>BROADCAST 2000 CONFIGURATION</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

In <B>settings->preferences->video</B> are the settings for video input
and output.  Set the paths to <B>/dev/jvideo</B> and set the drivers to
<B>LML33</B>.  You can optionally set just the playback or just the record to
LML33.<P>

Trying to play anything but bare MJPEG Quicktime movies to LML33
results in a blank screen.<P>

All operations involving the LML33 must be in 720x480 resolution.<P>

<B>RECORDING VIDEO</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Recording from the LML33 is only possible when using <B>Quicktime</B>. 
The compressor automatically defaults to <B>MJPG</B>.<P>

The record preview contains an extra button: <B>swap fields</B>.  Since
the field order on the LML33 is undefined the <B>swap fields</B> button
allows you to define the field order manually.  After recording, the
field order can still be swapped by using the <B>deinterlace</B>
plugin.<P>

Because of the way the LML33 is designed, any glitch causes the driver
to crash and reset, and usually changes the field order.<P>

The record preview automatically previews in RGB luminance while saving
data in 601 luminance.  To make the video suitable for display on
computers you'll need to apply the <B>RGB <-> 601</B> plugin.  For
playing back to the LML33, leave it alone.<P>

The LML driver buffers a certain number frames behind the audio, so
after recording, you'll need to shift the video forward by several
frames.<P>

<B>PLAYING VIDEO</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Playing video is a little more reliable.  Only sections of the timeline
consisting of bare Quicktime MJPA data are sent to the LML33.  To get
good results you must keep the output in 601 luminance.  If you have a
movie in RGB luminance you'll need to render it to an MJPA Quicktime
movie using the <B>RGB <-> 601</B> plugin.  Applying any realtime
plugins diverts the output from MJPA and causes a blank screen so
everything must be rendered to Quicktime and loaded back in.<P>

By default the LML33 can only play JPEG frames smaller than 128k.  Any
frame larger than 128k locks up the driver.  You can either render all
your movies in extremely low quality or increase the buffering
capability of the LML driver.  This can only be done when compiling the
LML33 driver by enlarging <B>lml33RamPerBoard</B> in <B>main.c</B> to
<B>0x10000</B> so the maximum frame size becomes 256k.
