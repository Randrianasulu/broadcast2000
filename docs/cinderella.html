<H1>THE CINDELERRA STORY</H1>

There was once upon a time, a gentleman who married for his second wife
the proudest and most haughty woman that ever was known.  She had been
a widow, and had by her former husband two daughters of her own
humour, who were exactly like her in all things. He had also by a
former wife a young daughter, but of an unparallelled goodness and
sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best
creature in the world.<P>

No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over, but the
mother-in-law began to display her ill humour; she could not bear the
good qualities of this pretty girl; and the less, because they made her
own daughters so much the more hated and despised. She employed her in
the meanest work of the house, she cleaned the dishes and stands, and
rubbed Madam's chamber, and those of the young Madams her daughters:
she lay on the top of the house in a garret, upon a wretched straw bed,
while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds
of the newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large,
that they might see themselves at their full length, from head to
foot.<P>

The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who
would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him intirely. When
she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney corner, and sit
down upon the cinders, which made her commonly be called in the house
Cinderbreech: but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the
eldest, called her Cindelerra. However, Cindelerra, not withstanding
her poor clothes, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters,
though they wore the most magnificent apparel.<P>

Now, it happened that the King's son gave a ball, and invited all
persons of quality to it: our young ladies were also invited; for they
made a very great figure. They were very well pleased thereat, and were
very busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as
might become them best. This was a new trouble to Cindelerra; for it
was she that ironed her sisters linnen, and plaited their ruffles; they
talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dress'd. For my
part, said the eldest, I'll wear my red velvet suit, with French
trimming. And I, said the youngest, will have my common petticoat; but
then, to make amends for that, I'll put on my gold flowered manteau,
and my diamond stomacher, which is not the most indifferent in the
world. They sent for the best tirewoman they could get, to dress their
heads, and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red brushes
and patches from Mrs. De la poche.<P>

Cindelerra advised them the best in the world, and offered herself to
dress their heads; which they were very willing she should do. As she
was doing this, they said to her, Cindelerra, would you not be glad to
go to the ball? Ah! said she, you only banter me; it is not for such as
I am to go thither. You are in the right of it, said they, it would
make the people laugh to see a Cinderbreech at a ball. Any one but
Cindelerra would have dressed their heads awry; but she was very good,
and dress'd them perfectly well. They were almost two days without
eating, so much were they transported with joy: they broke above a
dozen of laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a
fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.
At last the happy day came; they went to court, and Cindelerra followed
them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of
them, she fell a crying.<P>



HER godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter?
I wish I could--, I wish I could--; she could not speak the rest, her
tears interrupting her. Her godmother, who was a Fairy, said to her,
Thou wishest thou could'st go to the ball, is it not so? Y--es, said
Cinderilla, with a great Sob. Well, said her godmother, be but a good
girl, and I'll contrive thou shalt go. Then she took her into her
chamber, and said to her, go into the garden, and bring me a pompion;
Cinderilla went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and
brought it to her Godmother, not being able to imagine how this pompion
could make her go to the ball: her godmother scooped out all the inside
of it, having left nothing but the rind; she struck it with her wand,
and the pompion immediately was turned into a fine coach, gilt all over
with gold. After that, she went to look into her mouse-trap, where she
found six mice all alive; she ordered Cinderilla to lift up a little
the trap door, and she gave every mouse that went out a stroke with her
wand, and the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which all
together made a very fine set of six horses, of a beautiful
mouse-coloured dapple grey. As she was at a loss for a coach-man, I'll
go and see, says Cinderilla, if there be never a rat in the rat-trap,
we'll make a coach-man of him. You are in the right, said her
godmother, go and see. Cinderilla brought the trap to her, and in it
there were three huge rats: the Fairy made choice of one of the three,
which had the largest beard, and having touched him with her wand, he
was turned into a fat jolly coach-man, that had the finest whiskers as
ever were seen.

AFTER that, she said to her, Go into the garden, and you will find six
Lizards behind the watering-pot, bring them to me; she had no sooner
done so, but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up
immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with
gold and silver, and clung so close behind one another, as they had
done nothing else all their lives. The Fairy then said to Cinderilla,
Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the Ball with; are you not
pleased with it? O yes, said she, but must I go thither as I am, with
these ugly nasty clothes? Her godmother only just touched her with her
wand, and at the same instant her clothes were turned into cloth of
gold and silver, all beset with jewels: after this, she gave her a pair
of Glass Slippers, the finest in the world. Being thus dress'd out she
got into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her
not to stay beyond twelve a clock at night; telling her at the same
time, that if she stay'd at the ball one moment longer, her coach would
be a pompion again, her horses mice, her footmen lizards, and her
clothes resume their old form.

SHE promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball
before midnight, and then departed not a little joyful at her good
fortune. 

Episode 5 (Another version?)

The King's son, who was informed that a great Princess, whom they did
not know, was come, ran out to received her; he gave her his hand as
she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the hall where the
company was: there was a great silence; they left off dancing, and the
violins ceased to play, so attentive was every body to contemplate the
extraordinary beauties of this unknown person: there was heard nothing
but a confused noise of ha! how handsome she is, ha! how handsome she
is. The King himself, as old as he was, could not help looking at her,
and telling the Queen in a low voice, that it was a long time since
that he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature. All the ladies
were busied in considering her clothes and head-dress, that they might
have some made the next day after the same pattern, supposing they
might get such fine materials, and as able hands to make them.

THE King's son shewed her to the most honourable place, and afterwards
took her out to dance with him: she danced with so much gracefulness,
that they more and more admired her. A fine collation was served up, of
which the young Prince eat nothing, so much was he taken up in looking
upon her. She went and set herself down by her sisters, and shewed them
a thousand civilities: she gave them some of the oranges and lemons
that the Prince had presented her with; which very much surprised them;
for they did not know her. While the company was thus employed,
Cinderilla heard the clock go eleven and three quarters; upon which she
immediately made a courtesy to the company, and went away as fast as
she could.

ASSOON as she came home, she went to find out her godmother, and after
having thanked her, she told her, she could not but heartily wish to go
the next day to the ball, because the King's son had desired her. As
she was busie in telling her godmother every thing that had passed at
the ball, her two sisters knock'd at the door, Cinderilla went and
opened it. You have stay'd a long while, said she, gaping, rubbing her
eyes, and stretching herself as if she had been just awaked out of her
sleep; she had however no manner of inclination to sleep since they
went from home. If thou hadst been at the ball, said one of her
sisters, thou would'st not have been tired with it: there came thither
the most beautiful Princess, the most beautiful that ever was seen; she
shewed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and lemons.
Cinderilla seem'd indifferent; she asked them the name of that
Princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that the King's
son was very uneasy on her account, and would give all the world to
know where she was. At this Cinderilla smiled, and said, she must then
be very handsome indeed; Lord how happy have you been, could not I see
her? Ah! good Madam Charlotte, lend me your yellow suit of clothes that
you wear every day. Undoubtedly, said Madam Charlotte, lend my clothes
to such a Cinderbreech as you are, who is fool then? Cinderilla was
very glad of the refusal, for she would have been sadly put to it, if
her sister had leant her her clothes.

THE next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was 

Episode 6 (Another version?)

Cinderilla, but dressed more richly than she was at first. The King's
son was always by her, and saying abundance of tender things to her;
the young lady was no ways tired, and forgot what her godmother had
recommended to her, so that she heard the clock begin to strike twelve,
when she thought it was only eleven, she then rose up and fled as
nimble as a deer: the Prince followed her, but could not catch hold of
her; she dropt one of her Glass Slippers, which the Prince took up very
carefully; Cin- derilla came home quite out of breath, without coach or
footmen, and in her old ugly clothes; she had nothing left her of all
her finery, but one of the little Slippers, fellow to that she drop'd.
The guards at the palace- gate were asked if they had not seen a
Princess go out, who said, they had seen no body go out, but a young
woman very badly dress'd, and who had more the air of a poor country
wench than a lady.

WHEN the two sisters returned from the ball, Cinderilla asked them, if
they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there; they
told her, Yes, but that she flew away assoon as it had struck twelve a
clock, and with so much haste, that she drop'd one of her little Glass
Slippers, the prettiest in the world, and which the King's son had
taken up, that he did nothing but look at her all the time of the ball,
and that certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person
who owned the little Slipper. What they said was very true; 

Episode 7 (Another version?)

for a few days after, the King's son caused it to be proclaimed by
sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot this Slipper would
just fit. They began to try it on upon the princesses, then the
dutchesses, and all the court, but in vain; it was brought to the two
sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the
Slipper, but they could not effect it. Cinderilla, who saw all this,
and knew the Slipper, said to them laughing, Let me see if it will not
fit me; her sisters burst out a laughing, and began to banter her. The
gentleman who was sent to try the Slipper, looked earnestly at
Cinderilla, and finding her very handsome, said, it was but just that
she should try, and that he had orders to let every bo- dy do so. He
made 

Episode 8 (Another version?)

Cinderilla sit down, and putting the Slipper to her foot, he found it
went in very easily, and fitted her, and if it had been made of wax.
The astonishment her two sisters were in, were very great; but much
greater, when Cinderilla pulled out of her pocket the other Slipper,
and put it upon her foot. Upon this her godmother came in, who having
touch'd with her wand Cinderilla's clothes, made them more rich and
magnificent than ever they were before.

AND now, her two sisters found her to be that fine beautiful lady that
they had seen at the ball. They threw themselves at her feet, to beg
pardon for all the ill treatment they had made her undergo. Cinderilla
took them up, and told them, as she embraced them, that she forgave
them with all her heart, and desired them always to love her. 

Episode 9 (Another version?)

She was conducted to the young Prince dress'd as she was: he thought
her more beautiful than ever, and a few days after married her.
Cinderilla, who was as good as handsome, gave her two sisters lodgings
in the palace, and married them the same day to two great lords of the
court.
