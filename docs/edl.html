<H1>THE EDL</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE> The EDL is how Broadcast 2000 internally represents the
timeline you see on the screen.  It specifies where to put regions of
files on the timeline, without touching one sample or one frame.  This
way, Broadcast 2000 never loads files into RAM but loads pointers to
files into the EDL.  With EDL based editing, you'll arrange CDs much
faster than your Win98 buddies.<P>

EDL's are saved in a format called <B>hypertext audio language</B>
(HTAL).  Save a file and load it into a text editor and you'll see
something much like HTML or for Linux hackers, a web page.  In fact,
HTAL can be embedded in a web page.  Don't attempt to load a web page
and save it from Broadcast 2000 because you'll lose all the non HTAL
data.<P>
