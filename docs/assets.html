Assets in Broadcast 2000 are all the source files for all the edits
that appear on the timeline.  Try <B>Append</B>ing some files to the
current project and select <B>File->Assets...</B>  Here you see every
file you loaded.  You can delete files, view file attributes, rebuild
indexes, and append new tracks containing any asset listed.  You can
change the attributes for RAW audio files here.  If you cancelled an
index build previously, you can use <B>Rebuild index</B> to rebuild the
index.<P>
