<B>When will DV and firewire be supported?</B><P>

No.  The reason DV isn't supported is because the DV documentation, IEC
61834, costs $1000 to obtain.  In order to write software for it, you
must have a DV camcorder and a firewire port, which cost an additional
$2000.  There is seriously no profit motive behind this.  It's easy to
shield users from software costs.  There's no way to shield the users
from a $3000 hardware cost.  When you look at the cost of Premiere and
professional systems it's usually due to things like this.<P>

<B>Why does the GUI suck?</B><P>

The GUI was written in 1997, a year before GTK and QT existed.  No
performance needs have justified the cost of updating the GUI although
it would be trivial to do so. <P>
