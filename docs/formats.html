<B>SUPPORTED FILE TYPES</B><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Currently Broadcast 2000 can load any of the following formats:<P>

	<B>WAV FILES</B> 8, 16, and 24 bit linear.  Loading these gives you
a set of audio tracks just like any audio editor.<P>

	<B>Raw audio data</B> 8, 16, 24 bit or ULAW data.  You make up the
parameters.  This is especially useful for some MPEG encoders.<P>

	<B>MP2, MP3 audio data</B> Decoding only.  While useless on variable bit
rate files, seeking is pretty accurate on fixed bit rate files .<P>

	<B>MPEG-2 video</B> Decoding only.<P>
	
	<B>VOB files</B><P>

	<B>Quicktime movies</B> with video in MJPA, JPEG Photo, PNG, YUV
422, YUV 420, or RGB, and audio in IMA4, ULAW, 8, 16, or 24 bit linear
PCM.  Loading these gives you seperate video and audio tracks depending
on the data in the file.   The project is reconfigured to fit the
movie.  For PNG video, the compression is fixed to 9.  If you want no
compression use RGB.<P>

	<B>Still frame PNG, JPEG, and TIFF images.</B>  Loading these gives
you a video track with a certain number of copies of the still image,
cropped to fit in the project frames.  You can adjust the cropping
yourself.<P>

	<B>Lists of JPEG images.</B>  For hard core archanophiles you can
load a set of JPEG images to play sequentially.  The file you actually
load is a <B>JPEG list</B> file containing a listing of all the JPEG
images to be used.  The format of the JPEG list file can be discovered
merely by rendering a movie into JPEG list format and viewing the file
in a text editor.<P>

If Broadcast 2000 can't determine the file format, it automatically
assumes it's raw audio data and gives you a dialog box asking for
attributes of the file.<P>

If you can't get Quicktime movies in one of Broadcast 2000's supported
formats, you can still convert many formats using <A
HREF="http://heroine.linuxbox.com/toys.html"><B>XAnim,
Exporting edition and MPEG movie</B></A>.  This is a fully featured
version of XAnim with video exporting and a set of tools for exporting
uncompressed data from MPEG movies.  The MPEG movie package also
creates MPEG movies with video and stereo audio in case you want to
make MPEG movies.<P>
