<B>Most of the problems userse encounter are due to operating system
limitations.  Since Linux was designed for embedded systems, video
applications tend to go against the grain but there are ways around the
compacted nature of the operating system.</B>

<B>PROBLEM: THE DC10/BUZ/ZORAN/LML33/MJPEG ETC DRIVER LOCKS UP</B> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The following derivatives of the dc10/buz/zoran/lml33/mjpeg etc driver need to be patched:<P>

Version 0.6<BR>
Version 0.7<P>

Comment out the following segment in dc10.c:<P>

<PRE>
/*
 * 			if (zr->codec_mode != BUZ_MODE_IDLE) {
 * 				if (v.norm != zr->params.norm || v.channel != zr->params.input) {

<B>PROBLEM: THE BTTV DRIVER LOCKS UP</B> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The following derivatives of the bttv driver need to be replaced:<P>

Kernel 2.2.* Video4Linux 1<P>


Replace the bttv.c file with the patched version of bttv.c at <A
HREF="http://heroinewarrior.com/bcast2000.html">http://heroinewarrior.com/bcast2000.html</A>
to defeat most of the bttv lockups.  Overwrite the copy of bttv.c in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char and recompile the kernel.  This driver is omitted
from the shipped kernel for various pedantic reasons.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>TRYING TO RECORD FROM AN UNCOMPRESSED VIDEO SOURCE CRASHES IT</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Reason 1:</B> Issue <B>echo "0x7fffffff">/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</B> to increase the
amount of shared memory the operating system can allocate.<P>

<B>Reason 2:</B> There are separate configuration settings for audio
and video recording.  If you select video4linux for video capture the
audio may still attempt to capture from firewire.  Be sure to set the
<B>preferences->audio in</B>.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<B>RECORDING SPITS OUT FRAMES AND THEN PAUSES AND THEN SPITS OUT FRAMES</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Reason 1:</B> Your using software compression, attempting a higher
framerate and more compression than your computer is capable of.  Lower
the frame rate or compression quality or use a less demanding codec.<P>

<B>Reason 2:</B> Your hard drive is too slow.  Lower the framerate or
use a smaller format.<P>

<B>Reason 3:</B> Your hard drive is benchmarked fast enough but is
still responding too slowly.  Use the following script to flush the
operating system's cache every second, ensuring more consistant hard
drive performance.<P>

<CODE><PRE>
#!/bin/sh

while : ; do
	sync
	sleep 1
done</PRE>
</CODE>

<B>RECORDING 29.97fps DROPS FRAMES IN LINUX BUT WORKS FINE IN WIN95</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Reason 1:</B> You're using a derivative of the bttv driver which only allows
2 frames of buffering.  The following derivatives defeat this problem:<P>

Linux 2.4.* Video4Linux 1<BR>
Linux 2.2.* Video4Linux 2<P>

Load the Linux 2.4.0 Video4Linux 1 derivative with "gbuffers=32
gbufsize=0x100000" to allocate 32 frame buffers instead of 2.<P>

In Linux 2.2 install the Video4linux 2 derivative of the bttv driver.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>MY BT8** CARD ISN'T CAPTURING D-1 RESOLUTION</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The following derivatives of the bttv driver need to be hacked to support D-1
resolution:<P>

Linux 2.2.* Video4Linux 2<P>

You need to hack <B>btv/bttv-v4l2.c</B> to support it.  Change all the
occurances of <B>640</B> in <B>btv/bttv-v4l2.c</B> to <B>720</B>.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>THE LML33 DRIVER PRODUCES GARBAGE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME OR
DOESN'T FILL THE  ENTIRE FRAME</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The LML33 supports only 720x480 resolution.  Be sure to set the frame size
accordingly in <B>File->new</B> before you start to record.

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>RECORDING FROM MY FIREWIRE CAMCORDER DOESN'T WORK!</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Reason 1:</B> The operating system failed to detect the device when
you loaded the firewire modules, which is normal.  Linux1394 was mainly
designed for computer networking not camcorders.  You need to cancel
recording and reload the modules until it works.<P>

<B>Reason 2:</B> You power cycled your camcorder with the firewire
modules loaded and the operating system failed to redetect the device. 
You need to cancel the recording and reload the firewire modules.<P>

<B>Reason 3:</B> You plugged in your camcorder after the firewire
modules loaded and the device was never detected.  You need to cancel
the recording and reload the firewire modules every time you power
cycle the camera.<P>

<B>Reason 4:</B> You're not playing any video on the camcorder.  You
need either live video or tape playback for the firewire system to
work.  Once you start playing video, you'll automatically get a
picture.<P>

<B>Reason 5:</B> The audio must be set to 16 bit.  12 bit audio can't be
detected.<P>

<B>Reason 6:</B> Maybe you don't really like short haired blonds.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>NOT ALL THE IMAGES IN MY COMPOSITE ARE DISPLAYED!</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The <B>rendering strategy</B> in <B>settings->preferences->video</B> is
set to <B>fastest rendering</B>.  In order to perform compositing you
need to do something called <B>alpha blending</B>.  Every option except
<B>fastest rendering</B> enables alpha blending to varying degrees of
quality.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>THE TRACK VIEW AND POSITION INDICATOR FAIL TO KEEP UP WITH THE
MOVIE!</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

You either have <B>play every frame</B> enabled in
<B>settings->preferences->video</B> and your project contains audio or
your sound driver doesn't work.  In one case the position indicator
locks to the audio position regardless of which video frame is being
rendered and you need to disable playback on the audio tracks.<P>

In the other case you need to enable <B>use software for positioning
information</B> in the <B>settings->preferences->audio out</B>.


</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>WHEN I DEINTERLACE A MOVIE I GET GHOSTS WHENEVER A SCENE CHANGES OR
THERE'S FAST MOTION!</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

The two fields in an interlaced movie not only represent different
pixels of the frame but different points in time, usually 1/60 seconds
apart.<P>

Your movie was compressed in such a way that the chrominance components
for a single scan line are duplicated across two scan lines and thus
two points in time.  When you deinterlace it you see the chrominance
components of one point in time applied to the luminance components of
another point in time.  A better alternative is to either scale the
image to 1/2 or apply line average deinterlacing.

<B>PARTS OF THE AUDIO TRACKS ARE APPEARING EMPTY EVEN THOUGH THE TRACK WAS
SELECTED DRAWABLE</B> 

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

The <B>Number of index files to keep</B> setting is too low.  When you
closed another Broadcast 2000 session it deleted index files which your
current session needs to draw the waveform.<P>

<B>NOTHING I RENDER ENCODES ON REALPRODUCER</B>

Render as RGB video and 16 bit audio to encode on that piece of
crap.<P>

<B>WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT MULTIPLE SOUNDCARDS?</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Because there's no way to synchronize them.  An offset of as little as
1/40000 seconds causes something called <B>phase cancellation</B>.  4
channel soundcards are already becoming ubiquitous anyway.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>YOUR FSCKING SYNTHESIZER PLUGIN DOESN'T WORK!</B>

Deselect "Disable tracks when no edits" in preferences->playback and
select a region on the timeline to play back.<P>

<B>THE FRAMES LOOK COMPRESSED VERTICALLY OR HORIZONTALLY</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Set the aspect ratio in video->resize to what the movie should be viewed in.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>PLAYBACK JUST FREEZES UP AND DOESN'T STOP</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

You've got a plugin attached and configured to run impossibly slow. 
You should save the project, ctrl-C it on the command line, and
reconfigure the plugin.<P>

Alternatively you reproduced an idiopathic bug in single frame playback
which causes it to freeze up, usually during Xena.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>REVERSING VIDEO OR PLAYING VIDEO BACKWARDS PRODUCES GARBAGE</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Some file formats like MPEG require temporal information to render
frames, which isn't available when the file is read backward.  Render
the movie forward as Quicktime before reversing it.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>RENDERING AND PASTING TO THE TIMELINE PRODUCES ONLY BLANK FRAMES</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

If a movie exceeds 2 GB during a render or recording only the last
subfile is pasted into the project and the end padded with blank
frames.  You need to load from disk all the subfiles which made up the
recording and concatenate them.
