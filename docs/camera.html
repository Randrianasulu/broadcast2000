<B>THE CAMERA AND PROJECTOR</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The processing of video in Broadcast 2000 occurs much like it would in
a movie studio.<P>

Broadcast 2000 doesn't read the entire frames of video files.  It reads
a section of the video frames using the <B>camera</B>.  The camera
zooms and pans around the video frames using <B>camera automation</B>. 
The image the camera sees is processed through the console and
projected onto the output frame using the <B>projector</B>.  Where on
the output frame the image is projected is determined by <B>projector
automation</B>.<P>


<B>Video tracks</B> have <B>Camera and Projector</B> automation.  When
either of these automation selections is visible, you see a line down
the center of the track.  Make sure only one is visible at a time.<P>

<B>Left clicking</B> on the line creates and drags automation points.<P>

<B>Ctrl-left clicking</B> controls the pan of an automation point.<P>

<B>Ctrl-right clicking</B> controls the zoom of an automation point.<P>

<B>Shift-left clicking</B> adjusts the in and out pan handles of that
automation point.<P>

<B>Shift-right clicking</B> adjusts the in and out zoom handles of that
automation point.<P>

The automation works liks a bezier curve, where in and out handles
control the direction of camera movement in and out of the point.  The
same behavior occurs for the projector.<P>

Each edit also has its own <B>translation</B> setting.  In addition to
the automation setting, the camera positioning is relative to the
<B>translation</B> setting for each track.  <B>Middle clicking</B> on a
single edit of a video track changes the horizontal and vertical
translation of the track.  <B>Shift-middle clicking</B> on an edit
changes the zoom translation of the track.  These settings are reset by
selecting <B>Video->reset translation</B>.<P>

Notice Broadcast 2000 either draws the camera's line of sight or the
projector's projection on the output frame, but not both
simultaneously.  Select <B>View->Draw Output/View->Draw Tracks</B> to
determine which output you want to see.
