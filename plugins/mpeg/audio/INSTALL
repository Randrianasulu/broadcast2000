Building the MPEG audio encoding software:

If you have gnu make and are on a Unix-type system, you should only have to
type:

./configure
make

This will create a Makefile customized to your environment, overwriting the
previous Makefile, using Makefile.in as a template.

For other systems you may have to modify the Makefile. Some flags of
interest are:

BS_FORMAT
  Set to BINARY to work with most MPEG audio decoders (and save space). You
  can set it to ASCII, but your bitstream will only work with musicout().

HAVE_NINT
  Define this if your math library already has nint().

NDEBUG
  Define this to turn off all the assertions. Don't define this if you
  are developing code.

DEBUG
  Define this to get debugging messages printed to stdout.

For non-Unix systems you may have to define other things. Be sure to look
at common.h. If you build this on a Macintosh, be sure to use a fairly
recent set of Universal Headers. I have built this code on SunOS 4.1 and
Linux 1.3 (using gcc 2.6.3), and on the Power Macintosh (using Metrowerks
CodeWarrior 6).
